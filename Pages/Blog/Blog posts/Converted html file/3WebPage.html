<p>This website is one of my favourites that I have stumbled on. My first ever experiance with this was with Nmap, when I downloaded it but I never browsed the site more. However, the more I browse the site, the more amazed I am of how much information here. Old school hacking stuff, <strong>mailing lists archives</strong>, and <strong>security applications</strong> for monitoring and controlling on the <strong>network</strong>, and much more is on this website. Defenitly take a look</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/">OpenSecrets</a></p>
<p>This website follows the money in politics, catalouging and showing you how <strong>transactions go in politics</strong>. If you ever wanna try to predict a recession... there's probably better ways, but this is a good way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv.org</a></p>

<p>The USGS (United States Geological Survey) are a group who <strong>monitor the Earth</strong>, recording Earthquakes, Tornados, Natural disasters. They also have a great repository of data of the Earth. I think.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://awesomecars.neocities.org/oldlist">neocities.org</a></p>
<p>This webpage exists for one reason: to show a catalogue of videos of <strong>low resolution images of cars with overly loud music</strong> in the background.</p>

<p><a href="https://mh-nexus.de/en/programs.php">mh-nexus</a></p>
<p>This is where I got my <strong>Hex editor</strong>!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://travisdoesmath.github.io/pendulum-explainer/">n-Tuple</a></p>
<p>This <strong>pendelum</strong> made by TravisDoesMath, is my inspiration to make <a href="https://firecroc635.github.io/RotatingPoint/">this</a>. This document is very well written, and it is simply one of the things that got me so attracted into math.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/">Quanta Magazine</a></p>
<p>One of my beloved <strong>magazine</strong> websites, each post of theirs has a beautiful illustration, and each article is written with care. Truly a wonderful magazine. (if there be any controversies, I haven't heard of it. So don't be coming for me)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361850311_Structural_deviations_drive_an_uncanny_valley_of_physical_places">uncanny valley of physical places</a></p>

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://sci-hub.st/">Sci-Hub</a></p>
