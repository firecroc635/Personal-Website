# Cool Website I Found

1. [Insecure.org](https://insecure.org/fyodor/)

   This website is one of my favourites that I have stumbled on. My first ever experiance with this was with Nmap, when I downloaded it but I never browsed the site more. However, the more I browse the site, the more amazed I am of how much information here. Old school hacking stuff, **mailing lists archives**, and **security applications** for monitoring and controlling on the **network**, and much more is on this website. Defenitly take a look
2. [cpu.land](https://cpu.land/)

   A very neat website, that **teaches you how a CPU works**. From the basics, to executing code! Defenitly give it a look.
3. [Malware zoo on github](https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo)

   Cool little repository on github which contains a bunch of **live malwares**, which if you download them and run them, will infect you.
4. [OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/)

   This website follows the money in politics, catalouging and showing you how **transactions go in politics**. If you ever wanna try to predict a recession... there's probably better ways, but this is a good way.
5. [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/)

   an e-print repository with 2.4 million scholarly articles in fields of STEM, and Finance. So basically **research papers**
6. [usgs.gov](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/)

   The USGS (United States Geological Survey) are a group who **monitor the Earth**, recording Earthquakes, Tornados, Natural disasters. They also have a great repository of data of the Earth. I think.
7. [Trainiax](https://trainiax.net/index.php)

   Do you like **trains**? Well, you're gonna love this website to death. This website has a huge amount of data (drawings, photos, records) of various trains.
8. [StyleGAN2](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2)

   This is the algorithm used for the popular [This Person Does Not Exist](https://this-person-does-not-exist.com/en) website, and you can download the algorithm for yourself and create your own non-existing faces.
9. [neocities.org](https://awesomecars.neocities.org/oldlist)

   This webpage exists for one reason: to show a catalogue of videos of **low resolution images of cars with overly loud music** in the background.
10. [Universe Today](https://www.universetoday.com/)

    Space news!
11. [GovInfo.gov](https://www.govinfo.gov/#advanced)

    Essentially; **Governmental documents**, hearings, reports, bills, and so forth get published here. Most document records are catalogued in this website for all to see.
12. [mh-nexus](https://mh-nexus.de/en/programs.php)

    This is where I got my **Hex editor**!
13. [n-Tuple](https://travisdoesmath.github.io/pendulum-explainer/)

    This **pendelum** made by TravisDoesMath, is my inspiration to make [this](https://firecroc635.github.io/RotatingPoint/). This document is very well written, and it is simply one of the things that got me so attracted into math.
14. [Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/)

    One of my beloved **magazine** websites, each post of theirs has a beautiful illustration, and each article is written with care. Truly a wonderful magazine. (if there be any controversies, I haven't heard of it. So don't be coming for me)
15. [uncanny valley of physical places](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361850311_Structural_deviations_drive_an_uncanny_valley_of_physical_places)

    I found this **article about the uncanny valley** effect, and it was a cool read. The research in this article is really cool to read!
16. [Sci-Hub](https://sci-hub.st/)

    Do you hate paywalls, and sign-up walls for websites that have an article? Then use this website to **pirate those articles**.
