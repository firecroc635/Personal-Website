## As for right now

*I got a long way to finish my personal project*, and learning 3d graphics for the graphics was a pain (tip: don't use webgl if you don't wanna harness the full power of 3D and 2D graphics, and just want something simple). **Oh yeah the 2 other blog posts** are just tests so don't mind them ahah
