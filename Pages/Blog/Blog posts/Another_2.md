## ***Almost Daily updates***

### 1:36AM,  09/03/2024

I added my whole thing to github

[Link to the repo](https://github.com/firecroc635/Personal-Website)

### 2:28AM,  13/04/2024

I've finished a version of the comments, where it shows comments from a textfile.

![alt text](https://github.com/firecroc635/Personal-Website/blob/main/Pages/Blog/Blog%20posts/Converted%20html%20file/assets/Screenshot_20240313_022911.png?raw=true)

Later I will add a place for one to comment

### 3:01PM,  13/04/2024

I've decide to scrap this comment feature for the blogs for now, later I might add it but for now it's not gonna get used. **Note** the file is still in the directory, the created files still exist, and the lines in regards to the comments are commented so if I wanted to add comments again I could easily.

### 3:31PM, 13/04/2024

I've customised the scrollbar, unfortunatly this only works for webkit based browsers (I.E Chrome, Edge, Brave, so on) so it doesn't work for firefox unfortunatly.

### 10:24PM, 13/04/2024

Added ambient sound, I put a CRT in back constantly calculating 1/0 to create the sound.

### 2:49AM, 15/04/2024

Started work on the Projects page, currently below are the images on how it looks n stuff

This was the layout idea

## some other stuff

Yeah this whole website will eventually go up on github, thought it'll be a while from now.

## As for right now

*I got a long way to finish my personal project*, and learning 3d graphics for the graphics was a pain (tip: don't use webgl if you don't wanna harness the full power of 3D and 2D graphics, and just want something simple). **Oh yeah the 2 other blog posts** are just tests so don't mind them ahah
