## some other stuff

Yeah this whole website will eventually go up on github, thought it'll be a while from now.



## As for right now

*I got a long way to finish my personal project*, and learning 3d graphics for the graphics was a pain (tip: don't use webgl if you don't wanna harness the full power of 3D and 2D graphics, and just want something simple). **Oh yeah the 2 other blog posts** are just tests so don't mind them ahah

here's some math for all of you nerds
$$
\int_{b}^{a} (dx^n+7)dx = \left[\frac{d}{n+1}x^{n+1}+7x\right]_{b}^{a}\newline\space\newline
		= \left(\frac{d}{n+1}(a)^{n+1}+7(a)\right)- \left(\frac{d}{n+1}(b)^{n+1}+7(b)\right)
$$
