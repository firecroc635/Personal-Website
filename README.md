# Why is this on github?
_I am not someone who releases actual applications._
I'm mainly keeping this here, on _github_ just so I can archive then show-off the code for this project. I plan to update this as much as I can, until it is done of course. And on the website I write my updates in the **top blog**.

Also, you could probably get all the code from viewing page source

# when will this be done?
Frankely, it'll be a while. For me at least. But I think around 2 months or so.

# And uh yeah, enjoy!
